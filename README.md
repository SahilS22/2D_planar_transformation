# 2D_Planar_Transformation_Simulator
Introduction
The 2D Planar Transformations Simulator is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to apply an geometric transformations (Translation, Euclidean, Similarity, Affine) on a square shape and visualize the Outputs and results. This tool is designed for educational purposes to help users understand transformation concepts in computer vision.

## Features
1.Apply transformations such as Translation, Euclidean, Similarity, and Affine.


2.Visualize the original and transformed shapes in a 2D plot.


3.User-friendly GUI built using Tkinter.


4.Reset functionality to clear inputs and start fresh.

## Requirements
Before using the simulator, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.9 or above
Required Python libraries: numpy , matplotlib, tkinter (pre-installed with Python).

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
## How to Use
Run the Application:
```bash
python main.py
```
The GUI window will appear.
Select Transformation: Choose a transformation type from the dropdown menu: [Translation, Euclidean, Similarity, and Affine].
Enter the required parameters for the selected transformation:
Translation: Input tx and ty values.
Euclidean: Input angle, tx, and ty.
Similarity: Input scale, angle, tx, and ty.
Affine: Input a, b, c, d, tx, and ty.

Apply Transformation: Click Apply Transformation to visualize the result.
Reset: Use the Reset button to clear inputs and start again.
